# HW-Saver-ML-Assignment

Storyline
In a parallel universe, Amanda embarks on a journey to find a team of
highly skilled software engineers for her startup.
Mr. Robot and Silicon Valley were two of Amanda's favorite television
series. But in this universe, Elliot Alderson works for the government, and
Richard Hendricks does not destroy Pied Piper in the end. A world where
a few lines of code could solve problems or create menace. She was
intrigued when she got a chance to enroll in her first programming class.
Unlike some other girls from her class, she was convinced that this was the
path she wanted to take. During college, she completed multiple
internships in Machine Learning, enhancing her skills and expertise. After
her college, with a mission to build custom software for their clients, she
started Amanda Coding LLC. She wants to build a team of highly skilled
software engineers. For this, she wants to find teammates who meet all
the technical skills as per the job requirement.

Problem Statement
While researching, she found a raw dataset of over 30k datapoints
(Raw_Skills_Dataset.csv) which contain technical skills and a lot of jargon
mixed in.
Can you help her develop a code that can clean this dataset and extract
Technical (Hard) skills?

Know a bit more
What does technical skill mean? Technical skills are demonstrable and
quantifiable skills. They can be tested to prove their capacity in each hard
skill an individual possesses.
Sounded like blah, blah? We know, because it's much more difficult to
explain this theoretically so how about we show what it means. We have
attached some 900 random examples of technical skills
(Example_Technical_Skills.csv), go through them to understand the
pattern and sequence.

What do we need from you?
A couple of things, please:
- GitHub link for the Code you have written.
- A step-by-step document or presentation to describe your approach.

If you have a life, ignore this.
This is going to be difficult but if you can develop a code to bifurcate soft
skills and technical skills, you are a legend. This is just a bonus, so ignore
this if you want some peace of mind.
